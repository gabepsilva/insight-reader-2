# Help bindgen (used by soundtouch-ffi) find system headers when generating
# SoundTouch bindings. Clang needs stddef.h from the gcc include path.
# This path is Linux x86_64–specific. On macOS/Windows the "bundled" feature
# builds from source and typically does not need this; if build fails there,
# try unsetting BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS.
# If on Linux you get "stddef.h not found", change "13" to your gcc version
# (e.g. 12 or 14) in /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/<version>/include.
