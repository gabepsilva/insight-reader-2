# Architecture Decision Record

When making or revisiting a significant technical decision, document it.

## When to Use
- Choosing between libraries (e.g., EasyOCR vs PaddleOCR vs docTR)
- Changing module structure significantly
- Adding platform-specific behavior
- Changing data formats or config schemas
- Trade-offs with no obvious "right" answer

## ADR Format
```markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

## Context
What situation prompted this decision?

## Options Considered
1. **Option A** — pros / cons
2. **Option B** — pros / cons
3. **Option C** — pros / cons

## Decision
What we chose and WHY.

## Consequences
- What becomes easier
- What becomes harder
- What we're accepting as trade-offs
```

## Output
Save to `docs/adr/NNN-title.md`
```

## My Recommendation

Your current setup (after adding the Engineering Mindset to `AGENTS.md`):
```
.cursor/rules/
├── AGENTS.md                  # Always on — dev + senior mindset
├── code_simplification.md     # Pre-commit cleanup
├── code_review.md             # Thorough review
└── adr.md                     # Architecture decisions (optional but valuable)
